	abstract = {The operation of local {HPC} resources and especially of the Scientific Compute Cluster ({SCC}) at the {GWDG} is achieved by the transparent integration of different systems into a joint operating concept for the basic supply of the Max-Planck Institutes and the university. This includes a uniform software management, a shared batch management environment, cross-system monitoring and accounting, and cross-system file systems. Thus, synergies are achieved through the integration of different system generations and special-purpose systems (e.},

With Emmy, the {GWDG} and the University of Göttingen became one of eight {NHR}-Centers, thus formally making Emmy an {NHR}-system. Nonetheless, the {HLRN} Scientific Board decides on the admission of projects for 50 \% of the runtime available on Emmy.
See the Quickstart Guide for all necessary information on how to get access and started on the system.},
