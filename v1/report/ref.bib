This includes a uniform software management, a shared batch management environment, cross-system monitoring and accounting, and cross-system file systems. Thus, synergies are achieved through the integration of different system generations and special-purpose systems (e.},

	abstract = {With the wide application of time series databases ({TSDB}) in big data ﬁelds like cluster monitoring and industrial {IoT}, there have been developed a number of {TSDBs} for time series data management. Diﬀerent {TSDBs} have test reports comparing themselves with other databases to show their advantages, but the comparisons are typically based on their own tools without using a common well-recognized test framework. To the best of our knowledge, there is no mature {TSDB} benchmark either. With the goal of establishing a standard of evaluating {TSDB} systems, we present the {IoTDB}-Benchmark framework, speciﬁcally designed for {TSDB} and {IoT} application scenarios. We pay close attention to some special data ingestion scenarios and summarize 10 basic queries types. We use this benchmark to compare four {TSDB} systems: {InﬂuxDB}, {OpenTSDB}, {KairosDB} and {TimescaleDB}. Our benchmark framework/tool not only measures performance metrics but also takes system resource consumption into consideration.},
